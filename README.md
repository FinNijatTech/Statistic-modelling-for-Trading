Our project focused on Moving Averages (MAs), utilizing Crossing EMAs and Single EMA for both asset groups. We optimized MA parameters for each asset, incorporating them into the portfolio based on Net P&L in both Momentum and Mean-Reverting Strategies.

No additional assumptions have been considered, only the commonly accepted ones for both Group 1 and Group 2.

To determine optimal MAs parameters, we utilized both the HeatMap method and manual exploration. Our primary focus was identifying the most profitable configurations across the entire timeframe. In cases where multiple settings proved lucrative, we assessed their consistency in generating profits on a quarterly basis.
